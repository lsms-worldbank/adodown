{title:Description}

{pstd}This command is intended to be used when preparing a package for publication. Unless the option {inp:nogen_sthlp} is used, this command uses the command {inp:ad_sthlp()} (also in this {inp:adodown} package) to generates the {inp:.sthlp}-files from the {inp:.mdhlp}-files. 
{p_end}

{pstd}It then takes package version and Stata version from the {inp:.pkg}-file in this package, and applies that together with the current date to the version meta data and settings in the {inp:.ado}-files and the {inp:.sthlp}-files. 
{p_end}

{title:Options}

{pstd}{bf:{ul:adf}older}({it:string}) is used to indicate the location of where the adodown-styled package folder already exist.
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{ul:und}ocumented}({it:string}) lists commands that are undocumented. Undocumented commands are not expected to have an help-file. This command throws an error if an expected help-file is missing. Undocumented commands are typically commands for testing or commands used as a utility in other commands in this package.
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:ssczip} generates a zip-archive ready to send to SSC. This zip-archive only include the ado-files, sthlp-files and ancillary files listed in the pkg-file. SSC require that all files are included without any subfolders, or any pkg-files or toc-files.
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:nogen_sthlp} disables the generation of {inp:.sthlp}-files from the {inp:.mdhlp}-files. If not used this command will run {inp:ad_sthlp()} on the package in {inp:adfolder()}. 
{p_end}

{title:example}

{dlgtab:Example 1}

{pstd}This example assumes that there is already a adodown-styled package folder at the location the local {inp:myfolder} is pointing to, and that some commands have already been created. Any mdhlp-files in the {inp:mdhlp} folder in the folder {inp:myfolder} is pointing to will be rendered to Stata helpfile format and saved in the {inp:sthlp} folder. Then the command will update the version meta data 
{p_end}

{input}{space 8}* point a local to the folder where the package is located
{space 8}local myfolder "path/to/folder"
{space 8}
{space 8}* Render the Stata helpfiles
{space 8}ad_publish, adf("`myfolder'")
