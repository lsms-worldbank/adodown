{title:Description}

{pstd}This command is only intended to be used in package folders set up in the {inp:adodown} workflow using the command {inp:ad_setup}. 
{p_end}

{pstd}This command creates new commands in the package or removes existing commands from it.
When creating a command, a template for the {inp:ado}-file is created in the {inp:ado}-folder, 
a template for the {inp:mdhlp}-file is created in the {inp:mdhlp} folder, 
and the {inp:ado}-file and the {inp:sthlp} file is appended to the {inp:pkg}-file in that package folder. 
{p_end}

{pstd}See {browse "https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown/issues/27":this article} about valid syntax in the {inp:mdhlp} files. 
{p_end}

{title:Options}

{pstd}{it:subcommand} as specified in {inp:ad_command <subcommand> <commandname>} can either be {inp:create} or {inp:remove}. {inp:create} is used when creating a new command and {inp:remove} when removing and existing command. 
{p_end}

{pstd}{it:commandname} as specified in {inp:ad_command <subcommand> <commandname>} is the name of the command to be created or removed. An error is thrown if a command with this name already exists when using sub-command {inp:create}, and an error will be thrown when removing a command if no command with name already exists. 
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{ul:adf}older}({it:string}) is used to indicate the location of where the adodown-styled package folder already exist.
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{ul:pkg}name}({it:string}) is the name of the package expected to be found in the {inp:adfolder()}. 
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{ul:undoc}umented}  is used to create an undocumented command.
An undocumented command is a command that not intended to be used by the user,
and only be used by other commands in the same package.
In practice, this only means that no helpfile is created for this command.
