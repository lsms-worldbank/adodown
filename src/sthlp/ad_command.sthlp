{title:Description}

{pstd}This command is only intended to be used in package folders set up in the {inp:adodown} workflow using the command {inp:ad_setup}. 
{p_end}

{pstd}This command creates new commands in the package or removes existing commands from it. When creating a command, a template for the ado-file is created in the ado folder, a template for the mdhlp-file is created in the mdhlp folder,
and the ado-file and the sthlp file is addended to the pkg-file in that package folder.
{p_end}

{pstd}Note that the using {inp:net install} will not work immediately after creating a command with this file as the pkg-file points to the sthlp-file that is not yet rendered. Use the command {inp:ad_sthlp} to render that command. 
{p_end}

{title:Options}

{pstd}{it:subcommand} as specified in {inp:ad_command <subcommand> <commandname>} can either be {inp:create} or {inp:remove}. {inp:create} is used when creating a new command and {inp:remove} when removing and existing command. 
{p_end}

{pstd}{it:commandname} as specified in {inp:ad_command <subcommand> <commandname>} is the name of the command to be created or removed. If a command is created then an error is thrown if the name is already used by an existing command, and an error will be thrown when removing a command if the name is not used by any existing commands. 
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{ul:adf}older}({it:string}) is used to indicate the location of where the adodown-styled package folder already exist.
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{ul:pkg}name}({it:string}) is the name of the package expected to be found in the {inp:adfolder()}. 
{p_end}

{pstd}{bf:{ul:undoc}umented}  is used to create an undocumented command.
An undocumented command is a command that not intended to be used by the user,
and only be used by other commands in the same package.
In practice, this means that no helpfile is created for this command.

{title:Examples}

{dlgtab:Example 1}

{pstd}This example assumes that there is already a adodown-styled package folder at the location the local {inp:myfolder} is pointing to. 
{p_end}

{input}{space 8}* point a local to the folder where the package will be created
{space 8}local myfolder "path/to/folder"
{space 8}
{space 8}* Package meta info
{space 8}local pkg "my_package"
{space 8}
{space 8}* Add command mycmd to the package folder
{space 8}ad_command create mycmd, adf("`myfolder'") pkg("`pkg'") 
{text}
{dlgtab:Example 2}

{pstd}This example includes the steps for how to create the adodown-styled package folder in the location the local {inp:myfolder} is pointing to. 
{p_end}

{input}{space 8}* point a local to the folder where the package will be created
{space 8}local myfolder "path/to/folder"
{space 8}
{space 8}* Package meta info
{space 8}local pkg "my_package"
{space 8}local aut "John Doe"
{space 8}local des "This packages does amazing thing A, B and C."
{space 8}local url "https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown"
{space 8}local con "jdoe@worldbank.org"
{space 8}
{space 8}* Set up adodown-styled package folder
{space 8}ad_setup, adfolder("`myfolder'") autoconfirm    /// 
{space 8}     name("`pkg'") author("`aut'") desc("`des'") /// 
{space 8}     url("`url'") contact("`con'") 
{space 8}
{space 8}* Add command mycmd to the package folder
{space 8}ad_command create mycmd, adf("`myfolder'") pkg("`pkg'")
