where _subcommand_ is either `create` or `remove` and _commandname_ is the name of the new command to create or the existing command to remove.

| _options_ | Description |

# Description

This command is only intended to be used in package folders set up in the `adodown` workflow using the command `ad_setup`.

This command creates new commands in the package or removes existing commands from it. When creating a command, a template for the ado-file is created in the ado folder, a template for the mdhlp-file is created in the mdhlp folder,
and the ado-file and the sthlp file is addended to the pkg-file in that package folder.

Note that the using `net install` will not work immediately after creating a command with this file as the pkg-file points to the sthlp-file that is not yet rendered. Use the command `ad_sthlp` to render that command.

# Options

_subcommand_ as specified in `ad_command <subcommand> <commandname>` can either be `create` or `remove`. `create` is used when creating a new command and `remove` when removing and existing command.

_commandname_ as specified in `ad_command <subcommand> <commandname>` is the name of the command to be created or removed. If a command is created then an error is thrown if the name is already used by an existing command, and an error will be thrown when removing a command if the name is not used by any existing commands.

__**adf**older__(_string_) is used to indicate the location of where the adodown-styled package folder already exist.

__**pkg**name__(_string_) is the name of the package expected to be found in the `adfolder()`.

# Examples

## Example 1

This example assumes that there is already a adodown-styled package folder at the location the local `myfolder` is pointing to.

```
* point a local to the folder where the package will be created
local myfolder "path/to/folder"

* Package meta info
local pkg "my_package"

* Add command mycmd to the package folder
ad_command create mycmd, adf("`myfolder'") pkg("`pkg'")
```


## Example 2

This example includes the steps for how to create the adodown-styled package folder in the location the local `myfolder` is pointing to.

```
* point a local to the folder where the package will be created
local myfolder "path/to/folder"

* Package meta info
local pkg "my_package"
local aut "John Doe"
local des "This packages does amazing thing A, B and C."
local url "https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown"
local con "jdoe@worldbank.org"

* Set up adodown-styled package folder
ad_setup, adfolder("`myfolder'") autoconfirm    ///
     name("`pkg'") author("`aut'") desc("`des'") ///
     url("`url'") contact("`con'")

* Add command mycmd to the package folder
ad_command create mycmd, adf("`myfolder'") pkg("`pkg'")
```
