Read the `adodown` package's [web-documentation]((https://lsms-worldbank.github.io/adodown/) where you find all helpfiles for the commands in this package, as well as articles with guides and best-practices related to the commands in this package.

# Description

This command is only intended to be used in package folders set up in the `adodown` workflow using the command `ad_setup`.

This command creates new commands in the package or removes existing commands from it.
When creating a command, a template for the `ado`-file is created in the `ado`-folder,
a template for the `mdhlp`-file is created in the `mdhlp` folder,
and the `ado`-file and the `sthlp` file is appended to the `pkg`-file in that package folder.

See [this article](https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown/issues/27) about valid syntax in the `mdhlp` files.

# Options

_subcommand_ as specified in `ad_command <subcommand> <commandname>` can either be `create` or `remove`. `create` is used when creating a new command and `remove` when removing and existing command.

_commandname_ as specified in `ad_command <subcommand> <commandname>` is the name of the command to be created or removed. An error is thrown if a command with this name already exists when using sub-command `create`, and an error will be thrown when removing a command if no command with name already exists.

__**adf**older__(_string_) is used to indicate the location of where the adodown-styled package folder already exist.

__**pkg**name__(_string_) is the name of the package expected to be found in the `adfolder()`.

__**undoc**umented__  is used to create an undocumented command.
An undocumented command is a command that not intended to be used by the user,
and only be used by other commands in the same package.
In practice, this only means that no helpfile is created for this command.

# Examples

## Example 1

This example assumes that there is already a adodown-styled package folder at the location the local `myfolder` is pointing to.

```
* point a local to the folder with the package where a new command will be created
local myfolder "path/to/folder"

* Package meta info
local pkg "my_package"

* Add command mycmd to the package folder
ad_command create mycmd, adf("`myfolder'") pkg("`pkg'")
```


## Example 2

This example includes the steps for how to create the adodown-styled package folder in the location the local `myfolder` is pointing to.

```
* point a local to the folder where the package will be created
local myfolder "path/to/folder"

* Package meta info
local pkg "my_package"
local aut "John Doe"
local des "This packages does amazing thing A, B and C."
local url "https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown"
local con "jdoe@worldbank.org"

* Set up adodown-styled package folder
ad_setup, adfolder("`myfolder'") autoconfirm    ///
     name("`pkg'") author("`aut'") desc("`des'") ///
     url("`url'") contact("`con'")

* Add command mycmd to the package folder
ad_command create mycmd, adf("`myfolder'") pkg("`pkg'")
```
