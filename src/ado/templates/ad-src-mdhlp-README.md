# Markdown help files

In the `adodown` workflow you should not create any files in this folder.
Files in this folder is intended to be created using the command `ad_command`.
The markdown files here are then converted into Stata help files in `.sthlp` format using `ad_publish` or `ad_sthlp`.
Those commands saves the converted helpfiles in the `stlhp` folder.

For syntax rules on how to write Stata helpfiles in markdown syntax in the `adodown` workflow, see [this article](https://lsms-worldbank.github.io/adodown/articles/mdhlp-syntax.html).

The content in this folder is also used to render a documentation website using the R-tool [`adodownr`](https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodownr).
