# Markdown help files

In the `adodown` workflow you should not create any of the files in this folder using the command `adnewcommand`. The markdown files here are then rendered into Stata help files saved in the folder `stlhp`. The content in this folder
is also used to render a documentation website using the R-tool `adodown`.

For syntax rules on how to write Stata helpfiles in markdown in the `adodown` workflow, see this article (_link to adodown vignette_).
