# Dev tools

This folder contains files that are relevant for the package, but not directly related to code development.
This includes SSC zip-file outputs from `ad_publish`, `adodown` run utils, support files for web documentation (logo, css etc.).

This folder is a great location for the team to create sub-folders for any content that does not fit into any other folder in the `adodown` structure.
