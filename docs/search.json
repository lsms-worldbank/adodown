    "text": "Utilities for streamlining Stata package development \n\n \nFor developers, adodown offers workflow commands that automate manual tasks at each stage of development. At project’s start, adodown creates the necessary scaffolding for the package (e.g., folders, pkg file, etc). For each package command, it uses templates to create necessary files (i.e., ado, documentation, unit test) and adds appropriate entries in the pkg file. For documentation, it allows developers draft in plain Markdown while creating standard help files in SMCL. And for publication, adodown collects the required files, puts them in proper format, and prepares a zip file for SSC submission.\nAlso, adodown automatically deploys a package documentation website. For users, this provides an easy way to discover packages, to understand what they do, and to explore how commands work–all without installing the package. For developers, this provides packages with a welcome web presence and offers a home for additional documentation (e.g., how-to guides, technical notes, FAQs), and keeps HTML documentation up to date with SMCL documentation through continuous deployment via GitHub Actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nad_command\nAdd new or remove existing command to the package\n\n\nad_publish\nRun all tasks intended to be done before publishing\n\n\nad_setup\nCreate up a new adodown-styled package\n\n\nad_sthlp\nConvert the mdhlp-files to SMCL format and save in sthlp-files\n\n\nad_update\nUpdate meta information stored in the pkg-file.\n\n\nadodown\nPackage command with utilities for the rest of the package\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo install the latest published version of the package:\n* install the package from the SSC package repository\nssc install adodown\nTo update the package:\n* check for and apply any available updates\nado update adodown, update\n\n\nThe version of adodown on SSC corresponds to the code in the main branch of the package’s GitHub repository.\nTo get a bug fix or test bleeding-edge features, you can install code from other branches of the repository. To install the version in a particular branch:\n* set tag to be the name of the target branch\n* for example, the development branch, which contains code for the next release\nlocal tag \"dev\"\n* download the code from that GitHub branch\n* install the package\nnet install adodown, ///\n  from(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown/`tag'/src\") replace\n\n\n\nIf you need to install a previously releases version of adodown, then you can use the following method. This can be useful, for example, during reproducibility verifications. To install the version in a particular release, set the local tag to the target release you want to install in this code:\n* set the tag to the name of the target release\n* for example v1.0, say, if the current version were v2.0\nlocal tag \"v1.0\"\n* download the code from that GitHub release\n* install the package\nnet install adodown, ///\n  from(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown/`tag'/src\") replace\n\n\n\n\nTo learn more about the package:\n\nConsult the reference documentation\nRead how-to articles\n\n\n\n\nLSMS Team, World Bank lsms@worldbank.org"

This workflow also makes writing both web-documentation and helpfiles easier. The helpfiles are written in markdown files that are then used both to render Stata helpfile in .sthlp-format using the ad_sthlp command, and to render web documentation that can, for example, be hosted in a GitHub Page.\n\n\nOptions\nadfolder(string) is used to indicate the location where package folder will be created. This folder can, for example, be a newly created GitHub repository cloned to the local computer.\nname(string) specifies the name of the package that will be created. This is the name that will then be used in ssc install <name> or net install <name>. A command with the same name will be created and added to the package. While this option is optional, this package meta data is required. If a name is not provided in this option, then the user will be prompted to enter the name interactively.\ndescription(string) specifies the description of the package. This is the description paragraph that will displayed when using ssc describe <name> or net describe <name>. If a description is not provided in this option, then the user will be prompted to enter the description interactively. Since this meta data is not required, the user can leave it empty.\nauthor(string) specifies the name of the author or authors of this package. This information will be included when using ssc describe <name> or net describe <name>. While this option is optional, this package meta data is required. If an author is not provided in this option, then the user will be prompted to enter the name interactively.\ncontact(string) specifies the contact information where a users of this package can ask for support. This information will be included when using ssc describe <name> or net describe <name>. If contact information is not provided in this option, then the user will be prompted to enter the contact information interactively. Since this meta data is not required, the user can leave it empty.\nurl(string) specifies a website for where this code is hosted. This should not be where the web-documentation generated in the adodown is hosted, but where the source code is hosted. The web-documentation will include a link pointing to the URL. If using GitHub, then the intended URL should be on this format: https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown. This information will be included when using ssc describe <name> or net describe <name>. If a URL is not provided in this option, then the user will be prompted to enter the URL interactively. Since this meta data is not required, the user can leave it empty.\nautoprompt suppresses the prompt for missing non-required input, such as package description or author. If this options is used, the command will assume that GitHub templates should not be used. When this option is used, the command will still prompt the user for the package name unless that is provided in name() or author() as that information is required.\ngithub makes the command add files useful if the package is stored in a GitHub repository. The two files that are added are a .gitignore file and a GitHub Actions workflow .yaml file. The .gitignore is tailored to adodown styled packages such that only required files are pushed to the repository. This ignore template may be modified if preferred or needed. The Github Actions workflow file includes instructions for an automated workflow to generate web based documentation. Read more about this workflow and how to enable it in your repository here. See guidelines for this workflow here.\n\n\nExamples\nThis example creates a package folder for a package named my_package in the location that the local myfolder points to.\n* point a local to the folder where the package will be created\nlocal myfolder \"path/to/folder\"\n\n* Package meta info\nlocal pkg \"my_package\"\nlocal aut \"John Doe\"\nlocal des \"This packages does amazing thing A, B and C.\"\nlocal url \"https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown\"\nlocal con \"jdoe@worldbank.org\"\n\n* Set up adodown-styled package folder\nad_setup, adfolder(\"`myfolder'\") autoprompt    ///\n     name(\"`pkg'\") author(\"`aut'\") desc(\"`des'\") ///\n     url(\"`url'\") contact(\"`con'\")\n\n\nFeedback, bug reports and contributions\nRead more about the commands in this package on the GitHub repository for the adodown package.\nPlease use the issues feature e to communicate any feedback, report bugs, or to make feature requests.\nPRs with suggestions for improvements are also greatly appreciated.\n\n\nAuthors\nLSMS Team, The World Bank lsms@worldbank.org"

Level 1 headers are formatted using the {title} tag when rendered to Stata helpfiles, and level 2 headers are formatted using the {dlgtb} tag.\nThere is no established convention in the Stata community that {title} and {dlgtb} have a level 1 and 2 relation between each other. This is simply a subjective implementation of ad_sthlp.\n\n\nAny line that starts with # will be treated as a level 1 heading and rendered as a title using the {title} tag. Everything that follows # will be used as the title text. Adding other types of formatting to the title text might work, but it is not supported, and therefore not recommended.\n\n\n\nAny line that starts with ## will be treated as a level 2 heading and rendered as a dialogue tab using the {dlgtab} tag. Everything that follows ## will be used as the dialogue tab text. Adding other types of formatting to the dialogue box text might work, but it is not supported, and therefore not recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText between __ (two _ underscores) tags, as in __bold text__, is formatted as {bf:bold text} when rendered to Stata helpfiles.\n\n\n\nText between _ (a single underscore) tags, as in _italicized text_, is formatted as {it:italicized text} when rendered to Stata helpfiles.\nIt is not possible to italicize bold font text. This is to make it possible to express as command name like ad_sthlp in bold font. _ is therefore ignored in bold font.\nAn italicized word can have a an underscore, such as in _hello_world_. An underscore is only interpreted as the end of an italicized span if it is followed by one of the following character  (a blank space), ), ,, ., :, /, {, }, [ or ]. so in label(_label_name_) the first underscore is interpreted as the beginning of the italic span. The second underscore is interpreted as part of the italic span as it is followed by the regular letter n. The third underscore is interpreted as the end of the italic span as it is followed by one of the special characters listed above.\n\n\n\nText between ** ** tags in bold font text, as in __**underlined text**__, is formatted as {bf:{ul:italicized text}} when rendered to Stata helpfiles.\nNote that underlined format is ignored unless it is applied to text already formatted with bold font. This is due to underlined formatting not existing in markdown, and markdown is used for the web documentation in the adodown workflow. The recommendation is therefore to use underlined formatting sparsely.\nHowever, underlined formatting has one important function in Stata helpfiles. It indicates the shortest allowed abbreviations of command and option names. Since abbreviations are only allowed for options in community written commands we will only focus on underlined formatting for abbreviations in option names.\nOption names are in bold font, and underline font should therefore only be used on text in bold font. This reduces the risk of relying too much on underlined formatting when writing Stata helpfiles and then realizing underlining is not supported in web documentation.\n\n\n\nHere are recommendations on how combine inline formatting to format syntax of command names and command option names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n__ad_sthlp__\nCommand named ad_sthlp. Do not use underline in command names as abbreviations are not allowed in names of community written commands.\n\n\n__option__\nOption named option. No parameter is allowed. No abbreviation is allowed.\n\n\n__**opt**ion__\nOption named option. No parameter is allowed. The option named is allowed to abbreviate to opt.\n\n\n__option__(_string_)\nOption named option. A string parameter is expected. No abbreviation is allowed.\n\n\n__**opt**ion__(_string_)\nOption named option. A string parameter is expected. The option named is allowed to abbreviate to opt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny text between two ` on the same line will be formatted using the {input} tag. You may not split the two ` across multiple lines. If unmatched ` are found, then a warning will be issued.\nIt is not possible to show a backtick ` in an inline comment. For example when trying to show a local referenced as in open `folder'/myfile.dta. The ` in the inline formatting will always be interpreted as the end of the inline code formatting when converted to Stata help files. It is still possible to show the backtick ` in code blocks (see below).\nAll other formatting will be ignored in text that is formatted as a code. This means that cd in ab_cd_ef will not be italicized. The _ signs will be kept and formatted as code.\n\n\n\n\nAny text between lines that starts with ``` (commonly referred to as a code block) will be formatted using the {input} tag. Any text following on the same line as ``` will be ignored when converting to Stata help files. Code blocks are suitable for longer examples of code.\nThe initial ``` will be replaced with the {input} tag, and the ending ``` will be replaced with {text}. The text in-between is indented 8 blank spaces (twice the indent for {pstd}).\n\n\n\nMarkdown links on the format [adodown](https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown) will be converted to SMCL links on the format {browse \"https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown\":adodown}. Only links to internet URLs are supported. Creating hyperlinks to resources installed in the local Stata installation, for example {help : generate}, are currently not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Syntax section the only table supported is the {synopt} table. This is a table that list all the options in the first column and provide a short description in the second column. The table may only be exactly two columns wide. When rendered into a Stata helpfile the column titles will be “options” and “Description” which is the Stata defaults. Only “options” will be italicized.\nThere is no way to have more than two columns in a {synopt} table. A {synopt} table has support for line breaks in the second column. It is possible to have multiple tables in the Syntax section. All of them will still be {synopt} tables.\n\n\n\nIn all other sections tables are generated using SMCL’s low level support for tables: {c |}{col X}{c TT}{hline Y} etc. There is no limit on the number of columns in these tables. However, there is no support for line breaks within a table cell. All columns will be as wide as the longest value in that column.\n\n\n\n\nAny line that starts with <!-- will be treated as a comment and be ignored when converting to .sthlp format. A comment ends with -->. If <!-- and --> are on multiple lines, then both those lines, as well as any lines in-between those lines, will be treated as comments.\nAnything on the same line as --> will be treated as a comment even if it comes after -->. A line with any text before <!-- will not be treated as a comment and a warning will be thrown. Due to these two behaviors it is not possible to do an inline comment where only part of a line is a comment. Hence, the line Not a comment <!-- comment --> not a comment will be converted verbatim and everything, including the <!-- and --> tags, will be displayed when viewing the helpfile."

This mean that you do not have access to all the features in smcl, but you can still write great documentation with the features you still have access to.\nAnother, and perhaps greater, advantage of writing the documentation in markdown files is that those files can automatically be rendered into web-based documentation. The part of adodown that renders the web-based documentation is written in R and uses Quarto. However, if you are hosting your adodown-styled Stata package on GitHub.com, then you do not need to know R or Quarto, as rendering the web-based documentation can be automated with GitHub actions."

    "text": "One of the main motivations for the adodown workflow is to make it easy to generate user-friendly web documentation. Web documentation creates a web site where users can browse documentation without first having to install the package from, for example, SSC. It also allows you to write supporting documentation that are not exactly help files. Such as this page you are reading right now.\nWhile encouraged, generating web documentation is optional in the adodown workflow. It is perfectly possible to use adodown to benefit from standardized Stata package practices without using web documentation. If you do not want to generate web documentation, then there is no need for you to follow the steps in this guide.\n\n\nThis guide assumes you host your adodown styled Stata package in a GitHub repository and that you will publish your web documentation using GitHub Pages. If this does not apply to you, see the last section of this page for other options.\nOn GitHub this workflow use GitHub actions to publish the GitHub page. At the time of writing this documentation, GitHub actions were free on public repositories. But please confirm this at GitHub Actions pricing page.\n\n\n\nTo enable adodown to publish web documentation you need to complete three steps. There is no requirement on the order you do the steps, but unless the order below is used, you will get error notifications until all steps are completed.\n\n\nYou typically need admin access to your repo to complete these step. Click on the repository Settings tab or go to https://github.com/<account_name>/<repo_name>/settings. If you cannot access this page you do not have admin access to this repo.\nThen go to Pages >> Build and Deployment >> Source. Then select GitHub Actions in the drop-down.\n\n\n\nYou need to create a personal access token to allow a GitHub Action to publish a GitHub Page.\nGo to your GitHub profile settings by clicking your profile picture and then select Settings. Then navigate to Developer settings >> Personal access tokens >> Fine-grained tokens >> Generate new token. Select Generate New Token (Classic).\nYou can name this token anything but name it something that makes you know what it is used for. In the GitHub Action this token will be called ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY so you can use the same name (Note) here. You also need to generate an expiration date for this token. After the token expires, you need to come back and repeat this step.\nYou then have to define a scope for this token. You can select “Repo”. Then click generate token.\nStore this token in a secure place like a password manager. If someone gets access to your key, then they can impersonate you on GitHub. You will never again be able to make GitHub to show it to you. If you lose access to the key, then you will have to repeat this step and generate a new key.\n\n\n\nIf you are starting a new adodown project then, run ad_setup and say yes when asked if you want to set up GitHub templates. Once this is done you only need to push a commit and the web documentation will be published. The web documentation will then be updated each time you push anything to the main/master branch.\nIf you had already set up your adodown package, and if you opt-in to create the GitHub templates, then the web documentation will update each time you push anything to the main/master branch.\nIf you had already set up your adodown package, but you did not opt-in for the GitHub templates, then you need to set up the workflow file manually. To do so, copy the content on this page into a file you save under the exact path .github/workflows/build_adodown_site.yaml. Then push this in a commit and the web documentation will be published. The web documentation will then be updated each time you push anything to the main/master branch.\n\n\n\nWait a minute or two after completing all the three steps above and then go to https://github.com/<account_name>/<repo_name>/settings/pages. The URL to the web based documentation is then listed at the top of the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R tool adodownr used to build this web documentation allows you to add a custom logo to the web browser tab of your web documentation. To do so, save the logo in a square sized .png file called logo.png. Save the file in /src/dev/assets/logo.png. Push the file to the repo and then the web documentation will be recreated with this logo in the web browser tab.\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to use the adodown(r) tools to generate web documentation even when not using a GitHub repository to host the code or when not using GitHub pages to host documentation. However, then you need to install the R-tool adodownr on your own computer, and run it yourself to build the website. See the documentation for adodownr for more details."

This folder can, for example, be a newly created GitHub repository cloned to the local computer.\nname(string) specifies the name of the package that will be created. This is the name that will then be used in ssc install <name> or net install <name>. A command with the same name will be created and added to the package. While this option is optional, this package meta data is required. If a name is not provided in this option, then the user will be prompted to enter the name interactively.\ndescription(string) specifies the description of the package. This is the description paragraph that will displayed when using ssc describe <name> or net describe <name>. If a description is not provided in this option, then the user will be prompted to enter the description interactively. Since this meta data is not required, the user can leave it empty.\nauthor(string) specifies the name of the author or authors of this package.

Since this meta data is not required, the user can leave it empty.\nurl(string) specifies a website for where this code is hosted. This should not be where the web-documentation generated in the adodown is hosted, but where the source code is hosted. The web-documentation will include a link pointing to the URL. If using GitHub, then the intended URL should be on this format: https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown. This information will be included when using ssc describe <name> or net describe <name>. If a URL is not provided in this option, then the user will be prompted to enter the URL interactively. Since this meta data is not required, the user can leave it empty.\nautoprompt suppresses the prompt for missing non-required input, such as package description or author. If this options is used, the command will assume that GitHub templates should not be used. When this option is used, the command will still prompt the user for the package name unless that is provided in name() or author() as that information is required.\ngithub makes the command add files useful if the package is stored in a GitHub repository. The two files that are added are a .gitignore file and a GitHub Actions workflow .yaml file. The .gitignore is tailored to adodown styled packages such that only required files are pushed to the repository. This ignore template may be modified if preferred or needed. The Github Actions workflow file includes instructions for an automated workflow to generate web based documentation. Read more about this workflow and how to enable it in your repository here.

    "text": "The adodown workflow is intended to make it easier to set up and maintain Stata packages. Such that, more time can be spend writing code instead of modifying pkg-files etc.\nThe adodown workflow also allows you to write documentation in markdown format, which is a format that is quicker to learn that Stata’s smcl. This mean that you do not have access to all the features in smcl, but you can still write great documentation with the features you still have access to.\nAnother, and perhaps greater, advantage of writing the documentation in markdown files is that those files can automatically be rendered into web-based documentation. The part of adodown that renders the web-based documentation is written in R and uses Quarto. However, if you are hosting your adodown-styled Stata package on GitHub.com, then you do not need to know R or Quarto, as rendering the web-based documentation can be automated with GitHub actions."

    "text": "This article provides documentation for how to write helpfiles in an adodown styled Stata package using mdhlp files. The mdhlp files are used as source both when building web based documentation and when rendering Stata helpfiles in .sthlp format.\n\n\nWe recommend that you use a template and do not start with an empty file. Easiest is to use ad_command when starting a new command to create both the .ado in the ado-folder for the code of the command, and the .md in the mdhlp-folder for the documentation. If you for any reason can not, or do not want, to use ad_command, but still want use this workflow, then you can manually download the template from here.\n\n\n\nThis is how ad_sthlp will render markdown syntax to the SMCL format that is used in Stata helpfiles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown syntax\nDescription\nSMCL syntax\nComment\n\n\n\n\n\nParagraph\nUsing {pstd}/{p_end} tags\nIn markdown a paragraph is not defined by a character. Instead, a paragraph is defined as text between empty lines with no other formatting (part from inline formatting). In the Title and Syntax sections the {phang} tag is used instead of {pstd}.\n\n\n#\nHeader level 1\nUsing {title:} tag\n\n\n\n##\nHeader level 2\nUsing {dlgtab:} tag\nNo formatting applied if using more #. As in ###, #### etc.\n\n\n__ __\nInline bold font\nUsing {bf:} tag\nIgnored within code formatting\n\n\n** **\nInline underlined font\nUsing {ul:} tag\nIgnored unless used for text already in bold font\n\n\n_ _\nInline italic font\nUsing {it:} tag\nIgnored in bold font\n\n\n` `\nInline code font\nUsing {inp:} tag\nAll other inline formatting is ignored within the ` tags\n\n\n``` / ```\nMultiline code block\nUsing {input}/{text} tags\nIgnores all formatting within the ``` tags\n\n\n[ ]( )\nHyperlinks\nUsing {browse link:text} tags\nMay not be combined with other types of formatting\n\n\n|   |   | / |--|--| / |   |   |\nTables\nUses {synopt} or {c |}{col X}{c TT}{hline Y} type syntax.\nThe two-column {synopt} syntax is used in the Syntax section. In all other sections the table is built using SMCL’s low level table syntax. The symbol \\| is not allowed in a cell of a table.\n\n\n<!-- / -->\nComments\nCommented lines are ignored\nSupports both multi and single line comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText that are not formatted as tables, headers or code blocks that follows an empty line will be interpreted as a paragraph and the {pstd} will be used.\nThe {pstd} tag will be added in the beginning of the first line of text, and {p_end} will added on it’s own line before the first subsequent empty line. This means that lines of text only separated by a line breaks will still be considered the same paragraph as long as there are no empty lines.\nIn the Title and Syntax sections, the {phang} tag is used instead of {pstd}. This is to highlight the command name in the special paragraphs typically found in those sections.\n\n\n\nad_sthlp has support for two header levels corresponding to markdowns header levels # for level 1 and ## for level 2. Level 1 headers are formatted using the {title} tag when rendered to Stata helpfiles, and level 2 headers are formatted using the {dlgtb} tag.\nThere is no established convention in the Stata community that {title} and {dlgtb} have a level 1 and 2 relation between each other. This is simply a subjective implementation of ad_sthlp.\n\n\nAny line that starts with # will be treated as a level 1 heading and rendered as a title using the {title} tag. Everything that follows # will be used as the title text. Adding other types of formatting to the title text might work, but it is not supported, and therefore not recommended.\n\n\n\nAny line that starts with ## will be treated as a level 2 heading and rendered as a dialogue tab using the {dlgtab} tag. Everything that follows ## will be used as the dialogue tab text. Adding other types of formatting to the dialogue box text might work, but it is not supported, and therefore not recommended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText between __ (two _ underscores) tags, as in __bold text__, is formatted as {bf:bold text} when rendered to Stata helpfiles.\n\n\n\nText between _ (a single underscore) tags, as in _italicized text_, is formatted as {it:italicized text} when rendered to Stata helpfiles.\nIt is not possible to italicize bold font text. This is to make it possible to express as command name like ad_sthlp in bold font. _ is therefore ignored in bold font.\nAn italicized word can have a an underscore, such as in _hello_world_. An underscore is only interpreted as the end of an italicized span if it is followed by one of the following character  (a blank space), ), ,, ., :, /, {, }, [ or ]. so in label(_label_name_) the first underscore is interpreted as the beginning of the italic span. The second underscore is interpreted as part of the italic span as it is followed by the regular letter n. The third underscore is interpreted as the end of the italic span as it is followed by one of the special characters listed above.\n\n\n\nText between ** ** tags in bold font text, as in __**underlined text**__, is formatted as {bf:{ul:italicized text}} when rendered to Stata helpfiles.\nNote that underlined format is ignored unless it is applied to text already formatted with bold font. This is due to underlined formatting not existing in markdown, and markdown is used for the web documentation in the adodown workflow. The recommendation is therefore to use underlined formatting sparsely.\nHowever, underlined formatting has one important function in Stata helpfiles. It indicates the shortest allowed abbreviations of command and option names. Since abbreviations are only allowed for options in community written commands we will only focus on underlined formatting for abbreviations in option names.\nOption names are in bold font, and underline font should therefore only be used on text in bold font. This reduces the risk of relying too much on underlined formatting when writing Stata helpfiles and then realizing underlining is not supported in web documentation.\n\n\n\nHere are recommendations on how combine inline formatting to format syntax of command names and command option names.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n__ad_sthlp__\nCommand named ad_sthlp. Do not use underline in command names as abbreviations are not allowed in names of community written commands.\n\n\n__option__\nOption named option. No parameter is allowed. No abbreviation is allowed.\n\n\n__**opt**ion__\nOption named option. No parameter is allowed. The option named is allowed to abbreviate to opt.\n\n\n__option__(_string_)\nOption named option. A string parameter is expected. No abbreviation is allowed.\n\n\n__**opt**ion__(_string_)\nOption named option. A string parameter is expected. The option named is allowed to abbreviate to opt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny text between two ` on the same line will be formatted using the {input} tag. You may not split the two ` across multiple lines. If unmatched ` are found, then a warning will be issued.\nIt is not possible to show a backtick ` in an inline comment. For example when trying to show a local referenced as in open `folder'/myfile.dta. The ` in the inline formatting will always be interpreted as the end of the inline code formatting when converted to Stata help files. It is still possible to show the backtick ` in code blocks (see below).\nAll other formatting will be ignored in text that is formatted as a code. This means that cd in ab_cd_ef will not be italicized. The _ signs will be kept and formatted as code.\n\n\n\n\nAny text between lines that starts with ``` (commonly referred to as a code block) will be formatted using the {input} tag. Any text following on the same line as ``` will be ignored when converting to Stata help files. Code blocks are suitable for longer examples of code.\nThe initial ``` will be replaced with the {input} tag, and the ending ``` will be replaced with {text}. The text in-between is indented 8 blank spaces (twice the indent for {pstd}).\n\n\n\nMarkdown links on the format [adodown](https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown) will be converted to SMCL links on the format {browse \"https://github.com/lsms-worldbank/adodown\":adodown}. Only links to internet URLs are supported. Creating hyperlinks to resources installed in the local Stata installation, for example {help : generate}, are currently not supported.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Syntax section the only table supported is the {synopt} table. This is a table that list all the options in the first column and provide a short description in the second column. The table may only be exactly two columns wide. When rendered into a Stata helpfile the column titles will be “options” and “Description” which is the Stata defaults. Only “options” will be italicized.\nThere is no way to have more than two columns in a {synopt} table. A {synopt} table has support for line breaks in the second column. It is possible to have multiple tables in the Syntax section. All of them will still be {synopt} tables.\n\n\n\nIn all other sections tables are generated using SMCL’s low level support for tables: {c |}{col X}{c TT}{hline Y} etc. There is no limit on the number of columns in these tables. However, there is no support for line breaks within a table cell. All columns will be as wide as the longest value in that column.\n\n\n\n\nAny line that starts with <!-- will be treated as a comment and be ignored when converting to .sthlp format. A comment ends with -->. If <!-- and --> are on multiple lines, then both those lines, as well as any lines in-between those lines, will be treated as comments.\nAnything on the same line as --> will be treated as a comment even if it comes after -->. A line with any text before <!-- will not be treated as a comment and a warning will be thrown. Due to these two behaviors it is not possible to do an inline comment where only part of a line is a comment. Hence, the line Not a comment <!-- comment --> not a comment will be converted verbatim and everything, including the <!-- and --> tags, will be displayed when viewing the helpfile."

    "text": "One of the main motivations for the adodown workflow is to make it easy to generate user-friendly web documentation. Web documentation creates a web site where users can browse documentation without first having to install the package from, for example, SSC. It also allows you to write supporting documentation that are not exactly help files. Such as this page you are reading right now.\nWhile encouraged, generating web documentation is optional in the adodown workflow. It is perfectly possible to use adodown to benefit from standardized Stata package practices without using web documentation. If you do not want to generate web documentation, then there is no need for you to follow the steps in this guide.\n\n\nThis guide assumes you host your adodown styled Stata package in a GitHub repository and that you will publish your web documentation using GitHub Pages. If this does not apply to you, see the last section of this page for other options.\nOn GitHub this workflow use GitHub actions to publish the GitHub page. At the time of writing this documentation, GitHub actions were free on public repositories. But please confirm this at GitHub Actions pricing page.\n\n\n\nTo enable adodown to publish web documentation you need to complete three steps. There is no requirement on the order you do the steps, but unless the order below is used, you will get error notifications until all steps are completed.\n\n\nYou typically need admin access to your repo to complete these step. Click on the repository Settings tab or go to https://github.com/<account_name>/<repo_name>/settings. If you cannot access this page you do not have admin access to this repo.\nThen go to Pages >> Build and Deployment >> Source. Then select GitHub Actions in the drop-down.\n\n\n\nYou need to create a personal access token to allow a GitHub Action to publish a GitHub Page.\nGo to your GitHub profile settings by clicking your profile picture and then select Settings. Then navigate to Developer settings >> Personal access tokens >> Fine-grained tokens >> Generate new token. Select Generate New Token (Classic).\nYou can name this token anything but name it something that makes you know what it is used for. In the GitHub Action this token will be called ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY so you can use the same name (Note) here. You also need to generate an expiration date for this token. After the token expires, you need to come back and repeat this step.\nYou then have to define a scope for this token. You can select “Repo”. Then click generate token.\nStore this token in a secure place like a password manager. If someone gets access to your key, then they can impersonate you on GitHub. You will never again be able to make GitHub to show it to you. If you lose access to the key, then you will have to repeat this step and generate a new key.\n\n\n\nIf you are starting a new adodown project then, run ad_setup and say yes when asked if you want to set up GitHub templates. Once this is done you only need to push a commit and the web documentation will be published. The web documentation will then be updated each time you push anything to the main/master branch.\nIf you had already set up your adodown package, and if you opt-in to create the GitHub templates, then the web documentation will update each time you push anything to the main/master branch.\nIf you had already set up your adodown package, but you did not opt-in for the GitHub templates, then you need to set up the workflow file manually. To do so, copy the content on this page into a file you save under the exact path .github/workflows/build_adodown_site.yaml. Then push this in a commit and the web documentation will be published. The web documentation will then be updated each time you push anything to the main/master branch.\n\n\n\nWait a minute or two after completing all the three steps above and then go to https://github.com/<account_name>/<repo_name>/settings/pages. The URL to the web based documentation is then listed at the top of the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe R tool adodownr used to build this web documentation allows you to add a custom logo to the web browser tab of your web documentation. To do so, save the logo in a square sized .png file called logo.png. Save the file in /images/logo.png. Push the file to the repo and then the web documentation will be recreated with this logo in the web browser tab.\n\n\n\n\nIt is possible to use the adodown(r) tools to generate web documentation even when not using a GitHub repository to host the code or when not using GitHub pages to host documentation. However, then you need to install the R-tool adodownr on your own computer, and run it yourself to build the website. See the documentation for adodownr for more details."
